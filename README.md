## Game Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where the goal is to get three of your marks ("X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 3x3 grid. This implementation includes an AI bot capable of playing as both "X" and "O" using the minimax algorithm with pruning, making it a challenging opponent for players.

## Installation

To play the game, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/denarvi/tic-tac-toe-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe-bot
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python and pygame installed on your system. You can install pygame using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Run the game using the following command:

   ```bash
   python runner.py
   ```

## How to Play

4. The AI bot will take its turn after you make your move. The game will continue until there is a winner or a draw.

5. If the game ends, you have the option to play again by clicking the "Play Again" button.
